THIS IS JUST A SIMPLIFICATION OF THE PROBLEM.
 i had changed name of the important variables hope you guys will figure it out :)


local_20 = 40

if the variable 1-9Input is less than 1:
    then we are setting the variable uVar2 = 4294967295(this is the decimal form of the given hex number.)


and if it is less than 10:
    we set i = 0

    and we run a while true loop:
        where we set checkVar as unsigned version of i(well we are just setting checkVar as 0.)

        then we set strLength as the string length of usernameInput

        if sVar3 is less than or equal to uVar4 we break from the loop.

        otherwise we set the array buffer[i] as character type of 1-9Input + usernameInput[i]
        then we increment i by 1 
                

after that we store iVar1 as the result of strcmp between local_58 and passwordInput

if they are equal then we get the message we are logged in

otherwise we get the message wrong password

then we set uVar2 as 0

the above where the else if parts the next is the else part

else part is just telling the number is too big and exiting out.
